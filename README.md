# Tiny-Tongue

Puzzle/platforming/action game using slingshot mechanics for Android

My first game dev project, done in spring 2016

### What I did in this project?
* Almost all the code was written by me
* Level loading was done reading png file and placing elements based on pixel color
* Levels are endless, with new elements generated on the fly, and get progressively more difficult
* Parallax scrolling
* Basic game logic
